# MultiBal

## CURRENT SYSTEM

We all have savings accounts at banks.

The purpose of these accounts are to safegaurd saved money.

The purpose of this project is to view this saved money more meaningfully.

Currently, our banks display our balances as a single balance.

We save money for various things including health expenses, educational expenses, personal expenses, travel expenses etc.


## THE PROJECT

The idea behind this project is to display the single balance as multiple balances each with a meaningful title.

The single balance is divided into, for instance, health savings, travel savings, education saving, and so on while the actual balance is still the total amount in the account.

This can be implemented at 2 levels: 1.User application level
                                     2.Banks' infrastructure level                  
                                     
## WHY THE PROJECT?

This helps in proper planning and meaningfiul visualization of the saved money.

## CHALLENGES

Need to sort out a bunch of things like, when a customer withdraws amount, which account title will it be cut from?
